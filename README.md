An interactive web-based physics simulation tool for visualizing and analyzing projectile motion, developed as part of a Final Year Physics Project at Lagos State University.

## üéØ Overview

This simulator demonstrates fundamental projectile motion principles through real-time visualization, allowing users to experiment with various launch parameters and observe their effects on trajectory, velocity components, and motion dynamics.

## ‚ú® Features

### Core Functionality
- **Real-time trajectory visualization** with parabolic path rendering
- **Dynamic velocity vector display** showing horizontal (vx), vertical (vy), and resultant components
- **Interactive parameter controls** for initial conditions
- **Multi-mode data display** (Position, Speed, Acceleration, Force, Energy)
- **Slow motion capability** for detailed analysis

### Technical Features
- **Responsive design** compatible with desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Dynamic scaling** that automatically adjusts viewport based on trajectory bounds
- **Professional UI/UX** with modern gradient design and smooth animations
- **Cross-browser compatibility** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **No external dependencies** - runs entirely in the browser

## üìä Physics Implementation

The simulator implements classical mechanics equations:

- **Horizontal Motion**: `x(t) = x‚ÇÄ + v‚ÇÄcos(Œ∏)t`
- **Vertical Motion**: `y(t) = y‚ÇÄ + v‚ÇÄsin(Œ∏)t - ¬Ωgt¬≤`
- **Range**: `R = (v‚ÇÄ¬≤ sin(2Œ∏))/g`
- **Maximum Height**: `H = (v‚ÇÄ¬≤ sin¬≤(Œ∏))/(2g)`
- **Time of Flight**: `T = (2v‚ÇÄ sin(Œ∏))/g`
